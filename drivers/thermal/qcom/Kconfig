	  This enables the thermal sysfs driver for the TSENS device. It shows
	  up in Sysfs as a thermal zone with multiple trip points. Disabling the
	  thermal zone device via the mode file results in disabling the sensor.

	  This enables the driver for Limits Management Hardware - DCVS block
	  for the application processors. The h/w block that is available for
	  each cluster can be used to perform quick thermal mitigations by
	  tracking temperatures of the CPUs and taking thermal action in the
	  hardware without s/w intervention.
