config QCOM_TSENS
	tristate "Qualcomm TSENS Temperature Alarm"
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on QCOM_QFPROM
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  This enables the thermal sysfs driver for the TSENS device. It shows
	  up in Sysfs as a thermal zone with multiple trip points. Disabling the
	  thermal zone device via the mode file results in disabling the sensor.
	  Also able to set threshold temperature for both hot and cold and update
	  when a threshold is reached.

config QTI_THERMAL_LIMITS_DCVS
	bool "QTI LMH DCVS Driver"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	depends on CPU_THERMAL
	help
	  This enables the driver for Limits Management Hardware - DCVS block
	  for the application processors. The h/w block that is available for
	  each cluster can be used to perform quick thermal mitigations by
	  tracking temperatures of the CPUs and taking thermal action in the
	  hardware without s/w intervention.

config QTI_AOP_REG_COOLING_DEVICE
	bool "QTI AOP Regulator cooling device"
	depends on THERMAL_OF && MSM_QMP
	help
	  This enables the AOP based Regulator cooling device. This cooling
	  device will be used by QTI chipset to place a floor voltage
	  restriction at low temperatures. The cooling device will message
	  the AOP using mail box to establish the floor voltage.
