	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on RPMSG && OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a
	  module. This will build a module called "qcom-smd-rpm".

config QCOM_SCM
	bool "Secure Channel Manager (SCM) support"
	default n
        help
	 Say y here to enable Secure Channel Mananger(SCM) support for SoC.

	help
	  Use this to report msm boot stats such as bootloader throughput,
	  display init, total boot time.
	  This figures are reported in mpm sleep clock cycles and have a
	  resolution of 31 bits as 1 bit is used as an overflow check.

config MSM_CORE_HANG_DETECT
       tristate "MSM Core Hang Detection Support"
       help
         This enables the core hang detection module. It causes SoC
         reset on core hang detection and collects the core context
         for hang. By using sysfs entries core hang detection can be
	 enabled or disabled dynamically.

config MSM_GLADIATOR_HANG_DETECT
       tristate "MSM Gladiator Hang Detection Support"
       help
         This enables the gladiator hang detection module.
         If the configured threshold is reached, it causes SoC reset on
         gladiator hang detection and collects the context for the
         gladiator hang.

config QCOM_SECURE_BUFFER
	bool "Helper functions for securing buffers through TZ"
