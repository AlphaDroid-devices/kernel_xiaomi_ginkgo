config QCOM_CPUSS_DUMP
	bool "CPU Subsystem Dumping support"
	help
	  Add support to dump various hardware entities such as the instruction
	  and data tlb's as well as the unified tlb, which are a part of the
	  cpu subsystem to an allocated buffer. This allows for analysis of the
	  the entities if corruption is suspected.
	  If unsure, say N

config QCOM_GSBI
        tristate "QCOM General Serial Bus Interface"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        select MFD_SYSCON
        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config QCOM_MDT_LOADER

config QCOM_PM
	bool "Qualcomm Power Management"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM && !ARM64
	select ARM_CPU_SUSPEND
	select QCOM_SCM
	help
	  QCOM Platform specific power driver to manage cores and L2 low power
	  modes. It interface with various system drivers to put the cores in
	  low power modes.

config QCOM_SMEM
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager (SMEM)"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on HWSPINLOCK
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager.
	  The driver provides an interface to items in a heap shared among all
	  processors in a Qualcomm platform.

config QCOM_SMD_RPM
	tristate "Qualcomm Resource Power Manager (RPM) over SMD"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on RPMSG && OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a
	  module. This will build a module called "qcom-smd-rpm".

config QCOM_SCM
	bool "Secure Channel Manager (SCM) support"
	default n
        help
	 Say y here to enable Secure Channel Mananger(SCM) support for SoC.
	 SCM provides communication channel to communicate with secure
	 world(EL2 and EL3) by using smc call.
	 SCM driver provides the support for atomic scm calls also.

config QCOM_SMEM_STATE
	bool

config QCOM_SMP2P
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Point to Point support"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	select QCOM_SMEM_STATE
	help
	  Say yes here to support the Qualcomm Shared Memory Point to Point
	  protocol.

config QCOM_SMSM
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory State Machine"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	select QCOM_SMEM_STATE
	help
	  Say yes here to support the Qualcomm Shared Memory State Machine.
	  The state machine is represented by bits in shared memory.

config QCOM_WCNSS_CTRL
	tristate "Qualcomm WCNSS control driver"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on RPMSG
	help
	  Client driver for the WCNSS_CTRL SMD channel, used to download nv
	  firmware to a newly booted WCNSS chip.

config MSM_BOOT_STATS
	bool "Use MSM boot stats reporting"
	help
	  Use this to report msm boot stats such as bootloader throughput,
	  display init, total boot time.
	  This figures are reported in mpm sleep clock cycles and have a
	  resolution of 31 bits as 1 bit is used as an overflow check.

config MSM_GLADIATOR_HANG_DETECT
       tristate "MSM Gladiator Hang Detection Support"
       help
         This enables the gladiator hang detection module.
         If the configured threshold is reached, it causes SoC reset on
         gladiator hang detection and collects the context for the
         gladiator hang.
