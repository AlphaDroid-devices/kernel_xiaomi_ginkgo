Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM PHY Transceivers

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "qcom,usb-ssphy" or "qcom,usb-ssphy-qmp-v2"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
Required "supply-name" examples are:
"vdd" : vdd supply for SSPHY digital circuit operation
"vdda18" : 1.8v high-voltage analog supply for SSPHY
- qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner

Optional properties:
- qcom,vbus-valid-override: If present, indicates VBUS pin is not connected to
the USB PHY and the controller must rely on external VBUS notification in
order to manually relay the notification to the SSPHY.
- qcom,deemphasis-value: This property if present represents ss phy
deemphasis value to be used for overriding into SSPHY register.
- qcom,primary-phy: If present, indicates this is a secondary PHY and is
dependent on the primary PHY referenced by this phandle.
- qcom,override-pll-calibration: If present, program PHY register to overrride
the automatic PHY PLL calibration settings.
- qcom,qmp-misc-config: If present, program PHY miscellaneous device-specific
registers.

Example:
ssphy@f9200000 {
compatible = "qcom,usb-ssphy";
reg = <0xf9200000 0xfc000>;
vdd-supply = <&pm8841_s2_corner>;
vdda18-supply = <&pm8941_l6>;
qcom,vdd-voltage-level = <1 5 7>;
qcom,deemphasis-value = <26>;
};
