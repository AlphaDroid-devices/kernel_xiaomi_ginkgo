Bindings for Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. WLED driver

WLED (White Light Emitting Diode) driver is used for controlling display
backlight that is part of PMIC on Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. reference
platforms. The PMIC is connected to the host processor via SPMI bus.

	Definition: Specify if external PFET control for short circuit
		    protection is needed.

- interrupts
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop encoded array>
	Definition: Interrupts associated with WLED. Interrupts can be
		    specified as per the encoding listed under
		    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spmi/
		    qcom,spmi-pmic-arb.txt.

- interrupt-names
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <string>
