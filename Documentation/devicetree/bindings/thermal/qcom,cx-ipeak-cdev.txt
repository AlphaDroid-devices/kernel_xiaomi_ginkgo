Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CX Peak current cooling device

The CX IPEAK cooling device, will be used to set thermal client vote to
CX IPEAK  LM hardware. When all pre-defined clients on CX rail including
thermal client set their vote, CXIP LM hardware throttles pre-defined
client on the same rail.

Required Parameters:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,cxip-lm-cooling-device"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <values in hex>
	Definition: Must contain 2 variables <a b> where 'a' is the starting
		register address of the CX IPEAK LM hardware and 'b' is the
		size of the peripheral address space.

- #cooling-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. This is required by of-thermal and refer the doc
		<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more details.

Example:

	cxip_cdev: cxip-cdev@1fed000 {
		compatible = "qcom,cxip-lm-cooling-device";
		reg = <0x1fed000 0x24>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};
